Arctos is a collection management system for natural history museums.

Arctos is an ongoing effort to integrate access to specimen data, collection-management tools, and external resources on the Web. Nearly all that is known about a specimen can be included in Arctos, and, except for some data encumbered for proprietary reasons, data are open to the public.

Access Arctos: [http://arctos.database.museum/](http://arctos.database.museum/home.cfm)
